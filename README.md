# My Neovim Config

This is the configuration of my neovim editor.

It focus on simplicit and minimalis. However is **still a work in progress** üèóÔ∏è. My main focus is to use most of neovim native features, without relying in many plugins, also keeping everything in a single file.

## Plugins List
 - lspconfig
 - Mason
 - lazydev
 - nvim-treesitter
 - mini.nvim

## Installing yourself

If you want to use this configuration simply download the [init.lua](./init.lua), and open neovim with the following command.
```bash
NVIM_APPNAME="path/to/init.lua" nvim
```
